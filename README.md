# 👋 Hi there, I’m Mattew!

I'm a **web developer** and **gaming enthusiast** with a passion for crafting user-friendly websites and creative coding projects. Currently, I’m working on developing skills in both front-end and back-end, though I lean towards the frontend side. Here’s a little about me:

- **IdeaGPT** – A chatbot I built to provide unique ideas and inspiration.
- **HypeMC Website** – A multi-page, SEO-optimized site for a Minecraft server network, similar in style to Pika Network.
- **DesktopGPT** - My first Windows app that integrates chatgpt! (made bcuz only _mac_ users get the oficial app )
